http://sharelist.site/index.html

This is final project for ceng388 web programming lecture.
I made a site named sharelist that users can make playlist,
share and explore other users list. Users also can upload profile photos.
And system take log events that users sign up, sign in,
create new lists, add songs to a lists, upload profile photos, and eror log that may occurs
in logEvents.txt file.

There is a problem I could not figure out in database with some turkish characters.
This problem does not occur in local phpmyadmin database. But in online, 
database does not let users create a playlist with some turkish charecters.
Database lets create a table named 'kutişko' but does not let 'über'. So users should not 
make playlist with turkish characters in name of playlist.

source code is for local host database
